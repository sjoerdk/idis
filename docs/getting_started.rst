===============
Getting Started
===============

IDIS is a set of python / django modules that wrap around `CTP <https://mircwiki.rsna.org/index.php?title=MIRC_CTP>`_
to create an image de-identification server


Installation
------------
1. Clone the repo

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone https://github.com/sjoerd/idis.git
    $ cd idis

3. You can then start the site by invoking

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./cycle_docker_compose.sh

You can then navigate to https://gc.localhost in your browser to see the development site,
this is using a self-signed certificate so you will need to accept the security warning.
The ``app/`` directory is mounted in the containers, so if you make any changes to the code you will need to restart the processes.
You can do this when running ``cycle_docker_compose.sh`` by pressing  ``CTRL+D`` in the console window,
you can also kill the server with ``CTRL+C``.

Running the Tests
-----------------

TravisCI_ is used to run the test suite on every new commit.
You can also run the tests locally by

1. In a console window make sure the database is running

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./cycle_docker_compose.sh

2. Then in a second window run

.. code-block:: console

    $ docker-compose run --rm web pytest

If you want to add a new test please add them to the ``app/tests`` folder.
If you only want to run the tests for a particular app, eg. for `teams`, you can do

.. code-block:: console

    $ docker-compose run --rm web pytest -k teams_tests


Development
-----------

You will need to install pre-commit so that the code is correctly formatted

.. code-block:: console

    $ python3 -m pip install pre-commit

Please do all development on a branch and make a pull request to master, this will need to be reviewed before it is integrated.

We recommend using Pycharm for development.

Running through docker-compose
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You will need the Professional edition to use the docker-compose integration.
To set up the environment in Pycharm Professional 2018.1:

1. File -> Settings -> Project: grand-challenge.org -> Project Interpreter -> Cog wheel (top right) -> Add -> Docker Compose
2. Then select the docker server (usually the unix socket)
3. Set the service to ``web``
4. Click OK in both windows

Pycharm will then spend some time indexing the packages within the container to help with code completion and inspections.
If you edit any template files these will be updated on the fly.
If you edit any ``.py``, ``.css``, ``.js`` (etc) you will need to restart the processes using ``CTRL+D`` with ``cycle_docker_compose.sh``.
You can then add ``py.test`` test configurations to run the tests from within Pycharm.

Running locally
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Alternatively, it can be useful to run code from a local python environment - this allows for easier debugging and does
not require e.g. the professional edition of PyCharm. The setup described here uses all services from the normal
``docker-compose`` stack, except for the web service. Though this service is running, a separate Django dev server is
started in PyCharm (or from the terminal). As the dev server is running on port 8000 by default, there is no port conflict
with the service running in the docker container.

1. Run the ``docker-compose`` stack for the database and celery task handling

.. code-block:: console

    $ ./cycle_docker_compose.sh

2. Make sure you have ``pipenv`` installed.
3. In a new terminal, create a new virtual python environment using ``pipenv install --dev`` in this repository's root folder.
4. Activate the virtual env: ``pipenv shell``.
5. Load the environmental variables contained in ``.env.local``

.. code-block:: console

    $ export $(cat .env.local | egrep -v "^#" | xargs)

6. Run migrations and check_permissions (optionally load demo data).

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd app
    $ python manage.py migrate
    $ python manage.py check_permissions
    $ python manage.py initcomicdemo

7. You can now start the server using ``python manage.py runserver``.

8. To setup PyCharm:

   1. File -> Settings -> Project: grand-challenge.org -> Project Interpreter -> Select your created pipenv environment
   2. For each run/debug configuration, make sure the environmental variables are loaded,
      the easiest is to use `this plugin <https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7861-envfile>`_. Or they can be pasted after pressing
      the folder icon in the `Environmental variables` field.
   3. Useful to setup: the built-in python/django console in Pycharm:
      Settings -> Build, execution, deployment -> Console -> Python/Django console.
      Choose the same python interpreter here, and make sure to load the environmental variables
      (the .env plugin cannot be used here, the variables can only be pasted).


Creating Migrations
-------------------

If you change a ``models.py`` file then you will need to make the corresponding migration files.
You can do this with

.. code-block:: console

    $ docker-compose run web --rm --user `id -u` python manage.py makemigrations


add these to git and commit.


Building the docs
-----------------

To build the docs you need to install the environment on your local machine, we use pipenv for this.

1. Install pipenv

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pipenv

2. Install the environment from the root of the ``grand-challenge.org`` repo  with

.. code-block:: console

    $ pipenv install

3. You can then launch a shell in this newly created environment to build the docs

.. code-block:: console

    $ pipenv shell
    $ cd docs
    $ make html

This will create the docs in the ``docs/_build/html`` directory.


Adding new dependencies
-----------------------

Pipenv is used to manage the dependencies of the platform.
To add a new dependency use

.. code-block:: console

    $ pipenv install <whatever>

and then commit the ``Pipfile`` and ``Pipfile.lock``.
If this is a development dependency then use the ``--dev`` flag, see the ``pipenv`` documentation for more details.

Versions are unpinned in the ``Pipfile``, to update the resolved dependencies use

.. code-block:: console

    $ pipenv update

and commit the update ``Pipfile.lock``.
The containers will need to be rebuilt after running these steps, so stop the ``cycle_docker_compose.sh`` process with ``CTRL+C`` and restart.
